# Shopify Inventory Alert System

## Problem

Growing Shopify stores often discover inventory issues **after** damage is done:

- Overselling
- Stockouts
- Inventory wiped by apps or sync tools
- Manual stock checking multiple times a day

These issues lead to lost revenue, refunds, and customer trust erosion.

## Solution

This project is a backend system that monitors Shopify inventory changes in real time and sends alerts when risky situations occur — before they turn into money loss.

## What This System Does

- Listens to inventory change events from Shopify
- Tracks inventory history
- Detects risky inventory situations
- Sends alerts to store owners
- Runs fully in the background

## Status

🚧 In progress — built step by step with real-world eCommerce scenarios.

## Tech Stack

- Laravel
- Shopify Admin API
- Webhooks
- Background jobs & queues
- MySQL
